1: Log into the azure portal

2: Navigate to Virtual Machines and click 'New'

3: Select a appropriate name and the hardware specifications
	Best for a server (of our size) is atleast 2 cores and atleast 2GB RAM. (I used 4GB ram).
	a GPU can be used aswell but for a simple frontend for predicting, GPU wont make much difference.

4: Select the appropriate OS image, I used windows 10 v1809, as my code was written on windows and did not want inconsistencies.

5: Under Inbound port rules select 'Allow selected ports' and check RDP and SSH

6: Click 'Disks' from the above toolbar and select the type of HDD/SSD required.
	I chose standard SSD as HDD wouldve been too slow and premium SSD isnt required as we dont have much I/O.

7: Click 'Review + Create' and once statisfied, 'Confirm' to create. 

8: Once created, select your VM and under 'settings' click 'Networking'.

9: Click 'Add inbound port rule' and change the port to 5000 and change name appropriately (optional).

10: Once the VM is running, Click 'Configure' beside DNS name and add a DNS.

11: Click connect and select RDP and log into your VM. 

12: Install Miniconda and Git. 

13: Git clone the repo and install requirements into a conda environment

14: Run the server and access the server using your VMs Public IP with the 5000 port.
